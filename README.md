Full source code of the work developed in the course unit "Computer Labs", which is part of the Master's Degree in Informatics and Computer Engineering of the Faculty of Engineering of the University of Porto (FEUP).

The aim of the course unit is to give students the knowledge and skills required to use a PC's peripherals, develop low level and embedded software, program in C and use various tools of software development.

The folders named "labX" contain the source code submitted in lab number X. The "proj" folder contains the final project (Racinix) which uses libraries developed in the labs. The final result can be seen here: https://youtu.be/l85Aq9fY7Ok
